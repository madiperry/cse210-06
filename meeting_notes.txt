We're going to be reusing a lot of last weeks code to make a racing game. 

Joshua:
	Remake the snakes/cycles into the cars (maybe make them bigger, add a sprite on top)
	get rid of the tails.

Nathan:
	use code from the gree game 
	Work on Obstacles - have them move the player down/back
	Power ups - move the player up/forward


madi:
	Will work in the score to have 1 point added each time the player gets to the top of the screen
	first to 10 wins
	Game over???
	
	
Ross / William:
	will tackle adjusting the movement controls:
	Movement will be limited to half of the screen for each player. (edit min/max y for each car)
	No movement forward or backward. (remove the option from the keyboard controls)
	Draw a line in the middle of the 'track' to separate the players. 
	

Jermaine:
	Will once again take over testing functions and will do the readme for the game.
